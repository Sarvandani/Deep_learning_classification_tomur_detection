# Deep_learning_classification_tumor_detection
Tumore detection is very important task in medical imaging. I have shown how depp learning can help us to detect brain tumors from MRI images.

The data can be downloaded from the following link:

The histogram showing the images with and without tumor is being shown in the following:
