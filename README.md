# Deep_learning_classification_tumor_detection
Tumore detection is very important task in medical imaging. I have shown how deep learning can help us to detect brain tumors from MRI images.


The histogram indicating the images with and without tumor is being shown in the following:

4 MRI images have been visualized with and without tumor:

Training loss and validation loss after 139 epoch:
